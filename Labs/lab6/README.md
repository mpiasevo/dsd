# Lab 6: Video Game PONG
- Using https://github.com/kevinwlu/dsd/tree/master/Nexys-A7/Lab-6: Extended the FPGA code developed in Lab 3 (Bouncing Ball) to build a PONG game using a 800X600 Video Graphics Array (VGA) display and a 5 kOhm potentiometer with a 12-bit analog-to-digital (ADC) converter called Pmod AD1

- Modified the code using Professor Lu's Modifications

- Modified the code to make the "bat" larger to make the game easier.

- Included in this github are my modified files
